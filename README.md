# QoE-Affective-computing-Datatset

This work is proposed to describe and to share a subjective  QoE  dataset  that  assess  emotional factors of YouTube pltform users.
This dataset is collected in a controlled laboratory environment using YouTube JavaScript player and Video camera as a sensor. 
The  subjective  Absolute  Category  Rate  (ACR) method is used to evaluate the user's QoE based
on Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratting score. 

To build this dataset, a testbed is achieved in the LiSSi laboratory (http://lab.lissi.fr/) around Paris city in France. 21 
testers prticipated in the test campaign. All of them were researchers and students from different disciplines aged 18 to 34 
years  with  few  or  no  experience  with video assessment experimentation. The collected parameters concern many video 
parameters, network parameters and emotionals factors.

2- Data Set Information:

The dataset was built from a controlled laboratory testbed where 120 samples covering 22 Quality of Experience Impact Factors (QoE IFs). 
Three videos are used. Each on had a different type/complexity. 

The geographical location of the testbed was the LiSSi laboratory (http://lab.lissi.fr/) around Paris city in France.
62 testers prticipated in the test campaign.  

3- Attribute Information:

The dataset is presented in different formats/files as follows: 

The content of the dataset can be uploaded with differnt formats. These formats are: 

- name.csv : Microsoft Excel 2007 file.
- name.data : Open Document format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument


Both files contain 18 QoE IFs and the Mean Opinion Scors (MOS) given by users.
